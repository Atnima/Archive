### Dock and/or Keyboard Not Working
Generally the keyboard will start working again once you detach it and reattach the cover. When this doesn't work, or you also have issues with the dock, you can try a hardware reset as per the instructions below (see [The keys on the Cover donâ€™t work, but the touchpad does](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-au/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-surface-keyboards?os=windows-10)):

1. Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.
2. Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both. The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.
1. After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.
1. Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on.
