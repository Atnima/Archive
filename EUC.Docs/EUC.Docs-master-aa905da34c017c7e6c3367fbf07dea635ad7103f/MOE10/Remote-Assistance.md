## Remote Assistance
Technical staff in the  `MOEWIN7 - Remote Assistance` Active Directory group have the ability to remote control a user's device after being granted permission from the user. On the technical staff's PC, run Remote Assistance using the following command : `msra /offerra'. A prompt to enter either the hostname or IP address must be filled out, and then click the **Next** button.

The end user will need to click **Yes** to accept the request for the technical staff member to connect to their PC.

To take control of the PC, click the *Request Control* button in the top left of the Remote Assistance tool. The end user will need to click **Yes** to allow the technical staff member to share control of the desktop.

  Please note that the hostname does not always resolve to the current IP address, typically with tablet devices as they transition frequently between different networks. The user can be asked to open the *ICT Support* tool (the wrench/spanner) and click the *Device* tab along the top. This will display the current IP address for the device.
